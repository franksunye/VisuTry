## ï¿½ Notes

### Current Environment
- **Development**: Mock mode enabled by default
- **Real Services**: Configured via .env.local
- **Testing**: Manual E2E verification in local dev

### Key Decisions
- Focus on local dev verification before production deployment
- Use Stripe test mode for payment verification
- Keep mock mode as fallback for rapid development

### Blockers
- None currently
