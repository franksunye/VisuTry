# Frequently Asked Questions

## Who can use VisuTry?
E‑commerce teams, brands, and developers — plus individuals for self‑serve try‑on. Use the web entry for quick trials; enterprise can request API access and private deployments.

## What are the device requirements?
Any modern browser. Desktop or up‑to‑date mobile browsers work best. Stable network and clear photos improve results.

## How do I start?
Visit `/contact.html` to request a demo or integration details. Prepare a clear front‑facing photo or avatar and upload in the web interface.

## Is my data private?
Uploads are used only to generate try‑on results and aren’t stored long‑term by default. Enterprise options include expiry policies, isolated storage, and access controls.

## How is pricing structured?
Usage‑based or plan‑based pricing, with test credits and enterprise packages. Contact us for specific features and quotes.
