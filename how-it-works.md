# How It Works

This page explains VisuTry’s process, underlying approach, ideal users, and usage tips.

## What’s the principle?
We detect and fit user photos or avatars, align product geometry and appearance, and render realistic composite results.

## Flow
1. Choose category and style
2. Upload photo or avatar
3. Automatic fitting and rendering
4. Review, download, or switch styles

## Advantages
- No complex installs — works in the browser
- Multi‑category support (glasses, hats, accessories, apparel)
- Fast enough for e‑commerce and batch use

## Who should use it & conditions
Best for online retail, brand marketing, and self‑serve try‑on. Use clear front‑facing photos, good lighting, and natural pose for higher quality.
