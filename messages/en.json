        "question": "How does VisuTry's AI try-on work?",
        "answer": "VisuTry uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash AI to analyze your facial features and realistically overlay glasses onto your photo. The AI understands face shape, lighting, and perspective to create natural-looking results in seconds."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Is my photo data safe and private?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Your photos are encrypted during upload and processing. We never share your images publicly or use them for AI training without explicit permission. Free users' data is stored for 7 days, Credits users for 90 days, and Premium members for 1 year."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What's the difference between free and Premium quality?",
        "answer": "Free users get standard quality images (800×800 pixels) with a small watermark. Premium users receive high-quality images (1200×1200 pixels) without watermarks, plus priority processing and longer data retention (1 year vs 7 days)."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Can I use the generated images commercially?",
        "answer": "Yes! Premium and Credits Pack users can use their watermark-free images for any purpose, including commercial use. Free users receive images with a watermark for personal use only."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "How long does it take to generate a try-on?",
        "answer": "Most try-ons complete in 10-30 seconds. Premium users enjoy priority processing, which means faster results even during peak times. The exact time depends on server load and image complexity."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "What happens to my try-on history?",
        "answer": "Your try-on history is automatically saved based on your plan: Free users (7 days), Credits users (90 days), Premium users (1 year). You'll receive an email reminder 3 days before expiration, giving you time to download or upgrade."
